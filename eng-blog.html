<h1>02 The Lonely Genius:</h1>
<h3 class="main-heading">Lessons from Nikola Tesla's Extraordinary mind</h3>
 </div>
 <div class="container">
  <h2 class="ae">Introduction:</h2>
<p class="para2">
 He wasn't just a scientist.<br>
 He wasn't just an inventor.<br>
 <b>Nikola Tesla</b> was a visionary born far ahead of his time - a man who imagined a world 
 full of light, energy, and possibility while the rest were still groping in the dark.
</p>
<p class="para2">
  And yet, the world barely noticed him...<br>
  Until he was gone.
</p>
<p class="para2">
  But Tesla's story isn't just science - it's <b>pure inspiration.</b> It's the journey of a man who dared to think differently, lived boldly, and believed in his
  ideas even when the world laughed at him.
</p>
<h2 class="ae">‚öôÔ∏è The Power of Vision - Even in Isolation</h2>
<p class="para2">
  Tesla once said:<br>
  <b>"The present is theirs: the future, for which I really worked, is mine."</b></p>
  <p class="para2">These are not the words of a man seeking fame.<br>
  These are the words of a man with purpose.<br></p>
  <p class="para2">
    In a world that often misunderstood him, Tesla stood firm. He worked tirelessly - alone in labs, walking the streets
    of New York with no money, feeding pigeons, talking to stars - while his inventions quietly rewrote the future.</p>
    <p class="para2">
      From wireless electricity to <b>AC current,</b> to concepts of free energy - Tesla's 
      imagination knew no limits. He wasn't chasing wealth. He was chasing the truth.
    </p>
<h2 class="ae">Rejection, Failure, and Still - No Surrender </h2>
<p class="para2">
  Tesla faced betrayal.<br>
  His ideas were stolen.<br>
  His name was mocked(mimic).<br>
  He died poor and forgotten by most of the world. 
</p>
<p class="para2">
  But did he ever stop?<br>
  No.<br>
  Because real passion doesn't die when ignored. It burns brighter <b>when challenged.</b><br>
  He didn't invent for applause. He invented because he believed that the <b>world could be better</b> - and that he could help shape it.
</p>
<h2 class="ae">üí° Lessons Tesla Teaches Every Dreamer</h2>
<p class="para2">
  1. <b>Believe in your vision</b> - even if no one else does.<br>
  Tesla was ridiculed for wireless power. Today we have <b>Wi-Fi.</b><br>
  2. <b>You don't need noise to create impact.</b><br>
  Tesla worked alone, often in silence. Yet his legacy echoes louder than any fame.<br>
  3. <b>Work not for money, but for meaning.</b><br>
  Tesla gave up millions because he refused to compromise what he believed in.<br>
  4. <b>Stay curious. Stay obsessed.</b><br>
  He didn't chase - he chased <b>truth, possibility,</b> and <b>potential.</b>

</p>
<h2 class="ae">üåå A Final Thought: Be the Light, Even If You Stand Alone</h2>
<p class="para2">
  Nikola Tesla's life wasn't easy.<br>
  It was painful. Lonely. Often thankless.
</p>
<p class="para2">
  But today, he is celebrated as one of the <b>greatest mind in human history.</b><br>
  So if you're walking your own path, with no one clapping for you, no spotlight
   on your struggle - <b>keep walking.</b><br>
   <b>"Because the future may belong to those who believe in today's impossible." </b>
</p>
<h2 class="ae">üí¨ **You don't need the world's approval to change it.</h2>
  <p class="para2">
    You just need Tesla-like belief. Relentless. Quiet. Unshakable.**
